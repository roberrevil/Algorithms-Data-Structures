# Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The series starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are generated by adding the two previous numbers together.

The steps involved in generating the Fibonacci series are as follows:

1. **Input:** Take an input `n` to determine the number of elements in the Fibonacci series.
2. **Initialization:** Set the first two numbers of the series as `0` and `1`.
3. **Generate Series:** Starting from the third element, generate each subsequent number by summing the previous two numbers.
4. **Output:** Return the Fibonacci series of length `n`.

Here is a Python implementation to generate the Fibonacci series:

```python
def fibonacci_series(n):
    series = [0, 1]  # Initialize the first two numbers
    
    while len(series) < n:  # Generate subsequent numbers until desired length
        next_number = series[-1] + series[-2]
        series.append(next_number)
    
    return series
```

In the above implementation, `n` represents the desired length of the Fibonacci series. The series is initially set with the first two elements as `0` and `1`. Then, a while loop continues to generate subsequent numbers by summing the last two numbers in the series until the desired length is reached.

Finally, the function returns the Fibonacci series of length `n`.

The Fibonacci series grows exponentially, and the time complexity of generating the series is O(n), where n is the desired length of the series.
